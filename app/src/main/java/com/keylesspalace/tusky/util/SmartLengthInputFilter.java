	 * This method is called when the buffer is going to replace the
	 * range <code>dstart &hellip; dend</code> of <code>dest</code>
	 * with the new text from the range <code>start &hellip; end</code>
	 * of <code>source</code>.  Return the CharSequence that you would
	 * like to have placed there instead, including an empty string
	 * if appropriate, or <code>null</code> to accept the original
	 * replacement.  Be careful to not to reject 0-length replacements,
	 * as this is what happens when you delete text.  Also beware that
	 * you should not attempt to make any changes to <code>dest</code>
	 * from this method; you may only examine it for context.
	 * <p>
	 * Note: If <var>source</var> is an instance of {@link Spanned} or
	 * {@link Spannable}, the span objects in the <var>source</var> should be
	 * copied into the filtered result (i.e. the non-null return value).
	 * {@link TextUtils#copySpansFrom} can be used for convenience if the
	 * span boundary indices would be remaining identical relative to the source.
